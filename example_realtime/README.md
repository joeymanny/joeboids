## this example relies on sdl2

## here's what the sdl2 crate says about dependencies:

Install these through your favourite package management tool, or via http://www.libsdl.org/

Ubuntu example:

    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

Fedora example:

    sudo dnf install SDL2-devel

Arch example:
(Arch doesn't have separate regular and development packages, everything goes together.)

    sudo pacman -S sdl2

You might also need a C compiler (gcc).

## so like install those before u compile pls ok thx enjoy <3
